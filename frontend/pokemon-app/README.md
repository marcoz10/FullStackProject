Bruh its really easy

First navigate to the folder where the packson.json is

cd /frontend/pokemon-app

Then if its your first time running the react app, you have to install the dependencies.

$ npm install

This will take a hot second. After the pp's have been installed. You just run the app

$ npm start
or
$ npm run start

The react app comes with a development server that'll run on port 3000

In a browser go to localhost:3000

Boom
